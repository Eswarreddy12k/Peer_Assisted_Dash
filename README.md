# Peer_Assisted_Dash

If running locally run the StartPeers.js by Specifying the number of peers and start both dash-server.js and server.js using node.

If running in mininet, run pdash-topo.py to setup the network and copy the peer-template folder to each host in the mininet to act as a peer, and run both dash-server.js and server.js using node in seperate peers and see /metricsData endpoint to see the metrics.
